# [HTML5 Video Game Demo](https://japraj.github.io/gameDemo/ "HTML5 Video Game Demo")

Note that this build gives you a heavily upgraded account (godmode). To play:

- point and hold left-click to pull the minions to your cursor
- use A/D or arrow keys to move left and right
- press space to jump (experimental)
- destroy resources/enemies to level up
- try to head towards the top left of the map to see cool stuff!

This project is a work-in-progress. I am currently taking a break from this project to focus on work, school, and job applications. I plan to continue working on it in December! Planned improvements (actual list is 5 pages but these are the most relevant to the demo):

- I have a lot of plans to reduce file sizes and page-load times (specifically vendor/library, but also map files and user data)
- Need to add a main menu with single-player, multi-player, and puzzle mode! Currently I have just been working on the core game
- Add sounds, music, and objectives
- I plan to port the most heavily used parts of the physics engine (determined with a profiler) to AssemblyScript
- Need to add jump cooldown to the UI, and make the jump upgradable
- Most of the game will be rebalanced (ex. boost pads have too high of an acceleration value, enemies are too strong, etc)
